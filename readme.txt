Hide SiteOrigin widgets, rows and cells with display: none, opacity or by logged in logged out status.

Adds a new Visibility menu item to SiteOrigin Widgets, Rows and Cells. Options to set the opacity, display none with CSS, hide for logged in users and hide for logged out users. This does not adjust the rows cell or widget count so best to either hide entire rows or replace a widget with a suitable alternative.

== Installation ==
